# Toxic Comment Classification

A toxic comment is defined as a rude, dis- respectful, or unreasonable comment that is likely to make other users leave a discussion. 
The threat of abuse and harassment online means that many people stop expressing themselves and give up on seeking different opinions.
Platforms struggle to effectively facilitate conversations, leading many communities to limit or completely shut down user comments.

Using Toxic Comment Classification model using Natural Language Processing, we will be able to identify whether the comments are toxic or not and if they are toxic, user will not be able to comment it on the platform and thus making platform safe for discussion.
